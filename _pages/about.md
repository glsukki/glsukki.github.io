Hey,  
Sukruth here!

I am currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer @ [Dicer.ai](https://www.dicer.ai/) in the Generative AI domain for Advertisment Content Generation to improve the Ad Images and Descriptions by leveraging state-of-the-art LLMs in a iterative process. 

I graduated from my Masters in Computer Science at Cornell Univeristy, Ithaca, NY in August 2023. During my time at Cornell, I worked as a Graduate Teaching/Research Specialist for the course [CS 2024](https://courses.cs.cornell.edu/cs2024/2022fa/) \[C++\] during the Fall '22 semester.

My Masters Research project titled - "Humans, Robots, and Empathy: Investigating Bystander Reactions to Failure" - was focused on understanding the dynamics of human empathy in relation to task failure performance in both humans and robots in the Future Automation Research Laboratory (FarLABs) at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/) under the guidance of [Dr. Wendy Ju](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/wendy-ju/).
Upon graduation, I continued as a research intern involved in studies towards Domain Generalization of robots in _In-lab_ vs _In-the-wild_ environments.

This has allowed me to delve into the fascinating intersection of human behavior and technology. My interests primarily revolve around Machine Learning, Data Science, and Software Development.

Prior to my graduate studies, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Information Science and Engineering from [M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology (MSRIT)](https://www.msrit.edu/) in Bangalore.
Here, I received the \'Student Innovation Grant Award\' for my capstone project from the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Technology Park (ARTPARK), Indian Institute of Science (IISc).

This foundational education has equipped me with a strong technical background and a passion for exploring the latest advancements in the field.

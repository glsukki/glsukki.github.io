Hey,  
Sukruth here!

I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York and worked as a Graduate Teaching/Research Specialist for the course [CS 2024](https://courses.cs.cornell.edu/cs2024/2022fa/) \[C++\] during the Fall '22 semester.

I am currently interning as a researcher in the Future Automation Research Laboratory (FARLAB) at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/) under the guidance of [Wendy Ju](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/wendy-ju/), focusing on understanding the dynamics of human empathy in relation to task failure performance in both humans and robots. This has allowed me to delve into the fascinating intersection of human behavior and technology. My interests primarily revolve around Machine Learning, Data Science, and Software Development.

Prior to my graduate studies, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Information Science and Engineering from [M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology (MSRIT)](https://www.msrit.edu/) in Bangalore.
Here, I received the \'Student Innovation Grant Award\' for my capstone project from the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Technology Park (ARTPARK), Indian Institute of Science (IISc).

This foundational education has equipped me with a strong technical background and a passion for exploring the latest advancements in the field.
